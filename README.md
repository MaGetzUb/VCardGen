# VCardGen for Sailfish OS contacts
This is a simple utility to convert `contacts.db` from Sailfish OS into __vcard__ files. 
So if your device is softbricked, you can rescue your contacts from `/home/nemo/.local/share/system/privileged/Contacts/qtcontacts-sqlite/contacts.db`, and generate vcard files out of them. 
Then add the card files back into re-installation. But this is sort of a last resort, I recommend doing proper backups periodically.  

*PS. Use at your own risk!*
